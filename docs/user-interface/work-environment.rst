Project
-------

Each project gives access to a specific data catalog that is defined by
a topic, geographic location or mission of the institution that manages
the project.

By default, the “HOME” project is loaded (as in the figure above). If a
user previously visited MapX within the last 30 days, the last project
they consulted will be loaded. Users can change project and explore MapX
content by clicking on the dedicated button (name of the current
project). A panel listing all the projects to which they have access
(public and private projects in which they are members) is displayed in
the interface.

Login
-----

No password to remember! To login in MapX, users only have to provide
their email address to receive a single use password valid for 20
minutes. If after a few seconds no email from bot@mapx.org is visible in
your inbox, don't forget to check your SPAM folder. By logging in MapX,
users have access to additional functionalities and datasets/content
according to their privileges in the different projects.

Language of the interface
-------------------------

The MapX user interface is currently available in all the UN's six
official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish)
and in German, Bengali, Dari/Persian and Pashto. It can be changed
simply by clicking on the dedicated button. Note that only the interface
is translated into these languages. The data itself remains in the
language provided by the publishers.

Data catalog
------------

In a project, the data catalog is available in the **Project's views**
tab. The list of views in the data catalog depends on the user's role in
the project. Each of these views can be consulted by clicking either on
its title or on the colored circle next to the title. This action will
display the geospatial layer on the map and will expose data specific
functionalities and settings to the users. Views in catalog can be
filtered by keyword(s) or using one of the available filters under
**Advanced filter**.

Filtering views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can filter views that are available on the list through
keyword(s). The process can be performed by typing manually the
keyword(s) in the text field below the name of the project. The keywords
are searched in title and abstract of all available views for the
selected project and on the metadata of the source layers from which the views
were generated. Views can also be filtered by types, features and/or rights
from the **Advanced filter** module. Multiple selection is allowed
and can be managed in two different ways depending on the user's choice at
the bottom of the module: 1) “Intersection” (default) or 2) “Union”.
The first option displays views that satisfy all parameters while the second
results in a larger list of views, where displayed views are those that
satisfy at least one parameter. Finally, views can be filtered according
to their status (active on map or not).

.. _sorting-views:

Sorting views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The order of the views in the views' panel can be customized by each
user with a simple dragging action operated on the title of the view or
by using predefined alphabetic and date sorting methods. Furthermore,
each user can customize the appearance of its panel by grouping views
into user-made “categories” that can be seen as containers for views
that cover the same topic (i.e., “contextual layers” vs “biodiversity”)
or share any similarity.

The category-dedicated module is the environment that offers the
possibility to create new categories, rename them and change their
identity color within the views panel. The module can be accessed by
right clicking on the views panel or, directly, on a view. If a new
category is created after a right click on a view, the view is
automatically added to the new category. Otherwise, the new category
will be empty. Views can be inserted to and removed from each category
by dragging them across the panel. Users can create as many categories
and sub-categories as needed and move views as they please within the
panel of a project. The category module also offers two sorting methods
for views: by alphabetic order and by date. The action applies to the
content of a category. If no category exists, the sorting will affect
the whole catalog.

Users can save their data catalog organization in their web browser
without affecting the way other users experience the project by clicking
on “Save this state locally” in the categories' module. Please mind the
fact that using a different browser or clearing the cache from your
browser will reset the organization of all projects in their original
state. The original state is the organization of the views panel as it
is defined by the administrator of the project (i.e., the best way to
explore its content). This action can also be accomplished voluntarily
by clicking on the option “Reset original state” from the categories'
module. Users should not forget to click “Save this state locally” after
loading the original state or after any modification of the
organization.
